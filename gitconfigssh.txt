1. You mast have a public key from your mashine stored on github as SSH key here: 
https://github.com/settings/ssh

How to create ssh key on unix/mac os x:
 - Open terminal, go to the root typing: $ cd ~ (recommended)
 - Type: ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your@email.address"
 - To secure your ssh key ststem will ask you for passphrase (recommended) but you can skip it also
 - That's you have the ssh key
 - Check it with: $ ls -al ~/.ssh
 - Type: $ cd .ssh
 - Then open it with: $ less id_rsa.pub
 - Your ssh key is here and you can copy it to the github, or bitbucket and connect your terminal with online repos.

      # Attempts to ssh to GitHub
      
  You may see one of these warnings:

RSA key fingerprint is 16:27:ac:a5:76:28:2d:36:63:1b:56:4d:eb:df:a6:48.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

   (https://github.com/settings/ssh) 
   
4. Test the connection (in your terminal)
   $ ssh -T git@github.com
